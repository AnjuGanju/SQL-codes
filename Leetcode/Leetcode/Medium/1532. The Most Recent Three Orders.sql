SQL Schema
Table: Customers

+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| customer_id   | int     |
| name          | varchar |
+---------------+---------+
customer_id is the primary key for this table.
This table contains information about customers.


Table: Orders

+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| order_id      | int     |
| order_date    | date    |
| customer_id   | int     |
| cost          | int     |
+---------------+---------+
order_id is the primary key for this table.
This table contains information about the orders made by customer_id.
Each customer has one order per day.


Write an SQL query to find the most recent 3 orders of each user. If a user ordered less than 3 orders return all of their orders.

Return the result table sorted by customer_name in ascending order and in case of a tie by the customer_id in ascending order. If there still a tie, order them by the order_date in descending order.

The query result format is in the following example:

Customers
+-------------+-----------+
| customer_id | name      |
+-------------+-----------+
| 1           | Winston   |
| 2           | Jonathan  |
| 3           | Annabelle |
| 4           | Marwan    |
| 5           | Khaled    |
+-------------+-----------+

Orders
+----------+------------+-------------+------+
| order_id | order_date | customer_id | cost |
+----------+------------+-------------+------+

Result table:
+---------------+-------------+----------+------------+
| customer_name | customer_id | order_id | order_date |
+---------------+-------------+----------+------------+
| Annabelle     | 3           | 7        | 2020-08-01 |

| Winston       | 1           | 10       | 2020-07-15 |
+---------------+-------------+----------+------------+
Winston has 4 orders, we discard the order of "2020-06-10" because it is the oldest order.
Annabelle has only 2 orders, we return them.
Jonathan has exactly 3 orders.
Marwan ordered only one time.
We sort the result table by customer_name in ascending order, by customer_id in ascending order and by order_date in descending order in case of a tie.
